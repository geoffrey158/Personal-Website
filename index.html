      <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student at the University at Buffalo pursuing
          a Bachelor's degree in computer science. I am planning to also major
          in Finance or Business with computer science. I am currently a freshman student at UB.
          Before coming to the University at UB, I lived in Queens, New York.
          I graduated from Francis Lewis High School in Queens, New York.
          I was born on December 23rd, 1998. I have a brother that is 8 years older than me.
          I am an Asian American. My parents are from China. Some of my hobbies
          include basketball,tennis, gaming. and working out.

     <h2><u>My Career Path and Goals</u></h2>

         <ul class="article">
          <p>Why did I choose Computer Science?
            Computer science is challenging, and intriguing.
            It requires people in the field to be keep learning and pushing the limit.
            That fast paced innovation of technology constantly means computer scientists are in demand.
            I, however, had never thought about pursuing computer science as a career until I took an introductory class in my sophomore year
            in high school. The class sparked my interest in computer science and changed my thoughts after seeing what I could do with some simple line of codes.
            Computer science and programming can get frustrating at times. Sometimes I sit in front of the computer screen trying out figure how to do solve a problem
            for long periods of time, but it is very satisfying and awarding when I do figure out how to solve it. I took three computer science classes during high school.
            I started out with python during sophmore year and moved into C++ during junior year and then moved into java during senior year.
            Among all the three programming languages I liked C++ the most. I am hoping that if I
            pursue a degree in this field it can provide me knowledge and skills and along with my passion to develop softwares that would change
            the world. An ideal job for me would be to work at a big company like Alphabet(Google), Symantec, Microsoft, Facebook,etc.
