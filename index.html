	          I graduated from Francis Lewis High School in Queens, New York. 
            I am currently majoring in Computer Science. I am comtemplating on also majoring or minoring in finance or business administration.
            An ideal job for me would be to work at a big company like Alphabet(Google), Symantec, Microsoft, Facebook,etc.
            My dream job would be to become successful business owner. Some of my interests include basketball, tennis, gaming, and working out.
